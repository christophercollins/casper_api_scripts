# JSS Download All Eas

This script downloads all scripts in the JSS database and writes them to a location of your choosing.

Just edit the variables at the beginning of the script.

```JSS_URL = 'https://jss.mycompany.com:8443'
API_USER = 'api_user'
API_PASS = 'api_password'
WRITE_PATH = '/tmp/'```

It's been changed a bit from the download all scripts
